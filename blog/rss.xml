It is not intended to be a strict definition of who can or cannot use the NeoHaskell project, only a guide to help the project team make decisions. Everyone is welcome to use the NeoHaskell, regardless of whether they fit the target audience or user persona.</p><p>If a user doesn't fit the target audience doesn't mean that they shouldn't use NeoHaskell, it just means that the design process and showcasing process won't be prioritizing them.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="target-audience">Target Audience<a href="#target-audience" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Target Audience" title="Direct link to Target Audience">​</a></h2><p>The target audience of NeoHaskell are developers who have a maker/hacker philosophy, who are comfortable with a <strong>statically typed</strong> mainstream language like <strong>TypeScript or Java</strong>, and who are interested in developing a project as fast as possible in order to test an idea or prototype a product, <strong>even if they aren't the most experienced software developers</strong>. They are not interested in spending a lot of time learning a new programming language in depth, they are not interested in learning software architecture in depth, and they are not interested in spending a lot of time learning a new framework.</p><p>They do have interest of learning new things, as long as those are steps in the direction of their goal. They are willing to learn a new programming language, as long as they can start writing code in a few hours. They are willing to learn a new framework, as long as they can start using it in a few hours. They are willing to learn a new architecture, as long as they can start using it in a few hours.</p><p>These are not interested in having a perfect code quality from the beginning, so they <strong>won't be investing time in thoroughly testing their code</strong>, regardless of the testing methodology. And although they do not know it, they value working in a <strong>domain driven</strong> way.</p><p>They will probably be interested in learning more about the programming language, the framework, and the architecture, but only after they have a working prototype of their project.</p><p>They don't have enough time to spend in their projects, probably because they have a full time job, or they are students, or they have a family, or they have other hobbies. So they prefer much a command line tool that does everything for them, instead of having to research the different tools for their technology stack, and then having to configure them to work together.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="whos-not-the-target-audience">Who's not the target audience<a href="#whos-not-the-target-audience" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Who's not the target audience" title="Direct link to Who's not the target audience">​</a></h3><p>Well seasoned developers who have experience either in Haskell or in functional programming in general, and who are looking to apply concepts well established in the functional world.</p><p>Users who are interested in type theory, category theory, programming language theory, and other advanced topics in computer science.</p><p>Again, if a user doesn't fit the target audience doesn't mean that they shouldn't use NeoHaskell, it just means that the design process and showcasing process won't be prioritizing them.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="user-persona">User Persona<a href="#user-persona" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to User Persona" title="Direct link to User Persona">​</a></h2><ul><li><strong>Name</strong>: Danny</li><li><strong>Role</strong>: Junior Software Developer</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="actions-motivations-and-pains">Actions, Motivations and Pains<a href="#actions-motivations-and-pains" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Actions, Motivations and Pains" title="Direct link to Actions, Motivations and Pains">​</a></h3><ul><li><strong>What do I do?</strong><ul><li>Work full time as a software developer in a TypeScript sofware shop.</li><li>In the evenings and weekends I try to build up my portfolio by working on side projects.</li><li>Learning good practices, patterns, and technologies that act as a leverage for my learning process.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Why do I do it?</strong><ul><li>I want to improve my skills as a software developer.</li><li>Having a good portfolio will help me get a better job.</li><li>One of my projects might become a startup.</li></ul></li><li><strong>What do I want?</strong><ul><li>I want to build a project as fast as possible.</li><li>I want to have negotiation power by mentioning skills that are relevant in the market, regardless of the technology stack.</li><li>I want to have fun while learning.</li></ul></li><li><strong>What's stopping me?</strong><ul><li>There's a lot of things to learn, and I don't know where to start.</li><li>Many times, existing tools have so much pitfalls that I end up spending more time fixing them than actually working on my project, which is really frustrating.</li><li>I don't have enough experience to reason too much about all the side-effects that are happening under the hoods, that make my code behave in unexpected ways.
