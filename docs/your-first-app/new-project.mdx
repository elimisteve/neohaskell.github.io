# Creating a New NeoHaskell Project

## Introduction

Welcome to your journey of **developing a chat application with NeoHaskell**! This guide is designed to lead you through the creation of a chat application that leverages the unique capabilities of NeoHaskell. We aim to make this experience enriching, whether you are new to programming or an experienced developer.

You'll learn **how to set up your development environment, make sense of the project structure, and implement the core functionalities of a chat application.** Prepare to explore the world of NeoHaskell and develop an application that showcases your creativity and technical skills.

Let's embark on this exciting development adventure **together**!

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

Before diving into building your chat application with NeoHaskell, it's crucial to set up a proper development environment. A key component of this setup is selecting an appropriate code editor. For NeoHaskell, **Visual Studio Code** (VSCode) is the recommended choice due to its comprehensive support, ease of use, and free availability.

#### Steps to Set Up VSCode:

1. **Download and Install VSCode:**
   - Visit the [VSCode website](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and download the installer for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
   - Follow the installation instructions provided on the website or with the installer package.

2. **Configure VSCode for NeoHaskell:**
   - Once installed, open VSCode.
   - Customize the settings to your preference, and explore extensions specifically designed for NeoHaskell to enhance your coding experience.

3. **Familiarize Yourself with VSCode:**
   - Spend some time exploring VSCode's interface and features, such as the integrated terminal, source code management, and debugging tools. This will streamline your development process.

With VSCode set up, you now have a powerful and flexible editor that will aid you throughout your NeoHaskell development journey.

## Asking Neo to Create a New Project

To create a new NeoHaskell chat application, leveraging the ease of development provided by the framework, you would start by opening a terminal and navigating to a directory where you can create files.


We will use Neo, the NeoHaskell helper CLI tool to create the project. In the terminal you've opened run the following command:

```bash
$ neo new:project chat-app
```

This will create a NeoHaskell application named `chat-app` in a dedicated directory and install the necessary dependencies.

For a complete list of options available with the NeoHaskell application generator, you can execute `neo new:project --help`.

After creating the chat application, navigate to its directory:

```bash
$ cd chat-app
```

The structure of your NeoHaskell chat application, will likely include:

- `config/`: Configuration files for database connections, and other settings.
- `src/`: Contains all the entities, events, models, commands, views, and other components of your chat application. We will focus on this directory for the rest of this guide.
- `log/`: Log files for monitoring and debugging the application.
- `public/`: Static files and compiled assets.
- `README.md`: This is a brief instruction manual for your application. You should edit this file to tell others what your application does, how to set it up, and so on.
- `test/`: Test suites for your chat application's features.
- `tmp/`: Temporary files like cache and PID files.
- `.gitignore`: Lists files and patterns for Git to ignore.
- `neo.yaml`: Configuration file for the NeoHaskell project.

This structure supports the development of an efficient, event-driven chat application, maintaining a clean separation of concerns between the application's logic and its configuration.

Let's proceed to the next section where we'll guide you through the process of starting and managing the NeoHaskell web server, where we can start bringing your chat application to life.
