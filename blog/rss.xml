Everyone is welcome to use NeoHaskell, regardless of whether they fit the target audience or user persona.</p><p>If a user doesn't fit the target audience that doesn't mean that they shouldn't use NeoHaskell, it just means that the design process and showcasing process won't be prioritizing them.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="target-audience">Target Audience<a href="#target-audience" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Target Audience" title="Direct link to Target Audience">​</a></h2><p>The target audience of NeoHaskell are developers who have a maker/hacker philosophy, who are comfortable with a <strong>statically typed</strong> mainstream language like <strong>TypeScript or Java</strong>, and who are interested in developing a project as fast as possible in order to test an idea or prototype a product, <strong>even if they aren't the most experienced software developers</strong>. They are not interested in spending a lot of time learning a new programming language in depth, they are not interested in learning software architecture in depth, and they are not interested in spending a lot of time learning a new framework.</p><p>They are interested in learning new things, as long as those are steps in the direction of their goal. They are willing to learn a new programming language, as long as they can start writing code in a few hours. They are willing to learn a new framework, as long as they can start using it in a few hours. They are willing to learn a new architecture, as long as they can start using it in a few hours.</p><p>These are not interested in having a perfect code quality from the beginning, so they <strong>won't be investing time in thoroughly testing their code</strong>, regardless of the testing methodology. And although they do not know it, they value working in a <strong>domain driven</strong> way.</p><p>They will probably be interested in learning more about the programming language, the framework, and the architecture, but only after they have a working prototype of their project.</p><p>They don't have enough time to spend in their projects, probably because they have a full time job, or they are students, or they have a family, or they have other hobbies.

The principle advises that system components should act in alignment with widely accepted conventions and their syntactical indications. It encourages designers to ensure that the behavior of a system or feature closely matches users' existing knowledge and expectations to reduce the learning curve and prevent user astonishment. Although the principle originated in the late 1960s, it remains relevant in different technological platforms and settings to ensure that functionalities such as keyboard shortcuts, widgets, or method names are intuitive and adhere to familiar patterns for users, thereby enhancing user experience and system usability.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="examples">Examples<a href="#examples" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Examples" title="Direct link to Examples">​</a></h3><p>Those might not look like much, but they are details that end up stacking and streamlining the overall experience. The aim is to reduce the cognitive load on the user, and they are already learning a new language and ecosystem, so we should remove as much
stuff to learn as possible. For example, promoting:</p><ul><li>JSON or YAML as configuration formats instead of TOML or Dhall.</li><li>Git as the version control software instead of Darcs or Pijul.</li><li>GitHub as the code hosting platform instead of GitLab or BitBucket.</li><li>Visual Studio Code as the IDE instead of Emacs or Vim.</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="principle-of-developer-happiness">Principle of Developer Happiness<a href="#principle-of-developer-happiness" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Principle of Developer Happiness" title="Direct link to Principle of Developer Happiness">​</a></h2><p>The Principle of Developer Happiness prioritizes establishing an environment that aligns with software developers' professional and personal expectations, thereby enhancing satisfaction and retention. It underscores creating engaging experiences and a supportive culture where developers are fairly compensated, and find alignment with the group's mission. Additionally, it advocates for the use of efficient tools and technologies to streamline the development process and save time. Finally, it emphasizes continuous visibility into and assessment of developer efficiency through surveys and feedback, ensuring a continually optimized working environment that resonates with developer needs and expectations. This principle aims to meld operational strategies with developer satisfaction, ensuring an atmosphere that intuitively supports developers.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="examples-1">Examples<a href="#examples-1" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Examples" title="Direct link to Examples">​</a></h3><p>This principle emphasizes creating an environment that aligns with the expectations of both developers and users of NeoHaskell. It centers around fostering satisfaction, engagement, and a supportive community. Here are some examples:</p><ul><li><strong>Clear Documentation</strong>: Provide user-friendly and comprehensive documentation with code examples.</li><li><strong>Community Engagement</strong>: Encourage active participation and collaboration within the open-source community.</li><li><strong>Transparent Decision-Making</strong>: Maintain transparency in language development decisions.</li><li><strong>Inclusive Onboarding</strong>: Offer resources for developers of all skill levels.</li><li><strong>Recognition</strong>: Acknowledge and appreciate contributions and projects from the community.</li><li><strong>Feedback Channels</strong>: Create accessible channels for users and contributors to provide input and report issues.</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="principle-of-least-effort">Principle of Least Effort<a href="#principle-of-least-effort" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Principle of Least Effort" title="Direct link to Principle of Least Effort">​</a></h2><p>The Principle of Least Effort underscores the axiom that entities, within a given context, will opt for the solution that requires the minimal amount of work or complexity to achieve a specific goal. Applied within the realm of software design and development, it emphasizes creating systems and interfaces that are straightforward, easy to comprehend, and simple to interact with, thereby reducing the cognitive and operational load on both the user and developer. On the user's side, interfaces should be intuitive, providing the easiest pathway to accomplish tasks with minimum steps and complexity. For developers, this principle encourages the creation of code and architectures that are clean, succinct, and straightforward to understand and modify. Ultimately, adhering to the Principle of Least Effort enables the creation of more user-friendly applications and sustainably maintainable codebases, promoting efficient and effective interactions for all involved parties.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="examples-2">Examples<a href="#examples-2" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Examples" title="Direct link to Examples">​</a></h3><ul><li><strong>Simple Syntax</strong>: Design the language with a straightforward and intuitive syntax to reduce the cognitive load on developers using the language.</li><li><strong>Clear and Concise Documentation</strong>: Provide comprehensive yet concise documentation to help users understand and utilize the language effectively without unnecessary complexity.</li><li><strong>Standard Libraries</strong>: Include a well-organized standard library that simplifies common programming tasks, reducing the effort required to implement them from scratch.</li><li><strong>Error Handling</strong>: Implement user-friendly error messages and handling mechanisms that assist developers in identifying and resolving issues efficiently.</li><li><strong>Community Support</strong>: Foster a supportive community where developers can seek help, share knowledge, and collaborate, reducing the effort needed to overcome challenges.</li><li><strong>Version Management</strong>: Streamline version management and updates to make it easy for users to adopt new language features and improvements.</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Conclusion" title="Direct link to Conclusion">​</a></h2><p>In conclusion, the design principles outlined for NeoHaskell serve as a fundamental compass for the project's development and implementation processes.
