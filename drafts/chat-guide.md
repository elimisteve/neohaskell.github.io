- Quick Start Guide
  - Introduction to NeoHaskell and Chat Application
    - Understanding the functional programming paradigm
      - Functional programming is a style of programming that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state and mutable data. In NeoHaskell, this paradigm is a core concept that enables developers to write more predictable and bug-resistant code.
      - Explanation of functional programming concepts
        - Pure functions are the cornerstone of functional programming. A pure function is a function where the return value is determined only by its input values, without observable side effects. This makes the code easier to test and reason about.
        - Immutability is another key concept in functional programming. In NeoHaskell, once a variable is set, it cannot be changed. This eliminates issues related to shared state and concurrent programming, making your code safer and more reliable.
        - Higher-order functions are functions that take other functions as arguments or return them as results. This allows for more abstract and flexible code that can be easily reused.
        - Lazy evaluation is a technique where expressions are not evaluated when they are bound to variables, but rather when they are actually used. This can lead to performance improvements and the ability to work with infinite data structures.
      - Benefits of using NeoHaskell for functional programming
        - NeoHaskell's support for concurrent programming is built into the language. This makes it easier to write programs that can do many things at once, which is particularly useful for a chat application that needs to handle multiple users and messages simultaneously.
        - The strong type system in NeoHaskell helps prevent many common programming errors. Types are a powerful way to express the structure of your data and the behavior of your code, and the compiler uses them to ensure correctness.
    - Goals of the chat application project
      - Learning project structure and organization
        - The standard directory layout of a NeoHaskell project is designed to help you organize your code effectively. Understanding this structure will help you navigate and manage your NeoHaskell applications.
        - Each component in the project structure has a specific role. For example, the `src` directory typically contains your source code, while the `test` directory contains your test suites.
      - Building a real-world application with NeoHaskell
        - By implementing a chat application, you'll gain practical experience with NeoHaskell's features and idioms. This hands-on project will solidify your understanding of functional programming and how it can be applied to real-world problems.
        - You'll learn how to apply NeoHaskell concepts such as immutability, pure functions, and type safety to build a robust and scalable chat application.
  - Setting Up Your Development Environment
    - Steps to prepare your development environment for NeoHaskell
      - Before you start coding, you'll need to set up your development environment. This includes installing the NeoHaskell compiler, setting up your text editor or IDE, and possibly other tools like version control systems.
      - Requirements for setting up the environment
        - To develop with NeoHaskell, you'll need a few key pieces of software. This includes the NeoHaskell compiler, a text editor or IDE that supports NeoHaskell syntax (such as Visual Studio Code with the appropriate extensions), and any other tools or libraries that your project may require.
        - Your system will need to meet certain requirements to run NeoHaskell. These include having a compatible operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux) and enough memory and processing power to compile and run your applications.
      - Detailed setup instructions for different operating systems
        - The process for installing NeoHaskell and related tools can vary depending on your operating system. We provide detailed guides for each major OS to help you get started without any hiccups.
        - If you encounter any issues during setup, we offer troubleshooting tips to help you resolve common problems quickly.
    - Installation and tooling setup
      - Installing the NeoHaskell compiler is the first step in setting up your development environment. We'll walk you through the process and show you how to verify that it's been installed correctly.
        - In addition to the compiler, you may need to install other tools and libraries that your project depends on. We'll explain how to identify these dependencies and how to install them.
      - Configuring your development environment is crucial for productivity. We'll suggest configurations for your text editor or IDE that are optimized for NeoHaskell development.
        - Build automation and continuous integration are important practices for maintaining code quality. We'll describe how to set up these systems for your NeoHaskell projects.
